# Modulento

Self-hosted core for transaction platforms. The core knows accounts, roles,
extensions and scheduled tasks, but no business model; an extension turns an
installation into a freelancer marketplace, a restaurant ordering system, an
auction site and so on.

Plain PHP without a framework and without a build step: PHP ≥ 8.3, Twig,
MariaDB through PDO, vanilla JS/CSS.

**Status: stage 1 of 7 (core skeleton).** There is no catalogue, order or
payment code yet.

## Setup

```
composer install
cp .env.example .env          # fill in DB_*; APP_ENV="dev" while developing
php bin/migrate.php
php bin/create-admin.php you@example.com
php -S 127.0.0.1:8098 -t public public/index.php
```

Point the web server's document root at `public/` - nothing else may be
reachable from the web. Add one cron entry:

```
* * * * * php /path/to/modulento/bin/cron.php >> /path/to/modulento/var/log/cron.log 2>&1
```

Checks: `php tests/run.php`

## Releases and updates

A release is made by pushing a version tag:

```
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
```

`.github/workflows/release.yml` then runs the checks, builds
`modulento-<version>.zip` (committed files plus production dependencies and a
`VERSION` file) and publishes it with its SHA-256 checksum as a GitHub Release.

An installation made from such a package finds new releases under
**Administration → Updates**. An update verifies the checksum, backs up the
current files to `var/updates/backups/`, copies the new files and runs the
migrations of the core and of every enabled extension. It only adds and
overwrites files, so `.env`, `var/`, themes and third-party extensions stay.
The database is not backed up - export it before updating.

- `UPDATE_REPO` in `.env` names the repository to update from; empty switches
  updates off.
- While that repository is private, `UPDATE_TOKEN` needs a fine-grained GitHub
  token with read-only "Contents" access to it.
- A git working copy is never updated this way; use `git pull`,
  `composer install` and `php bin/migrate.php` there.

## Layout

```
core/         src/ (Modulento\Core), templates/, lang/, migrations/
extensions/   one folder per extension
themes/       template overrides, selected with APP_THEME
public/       web root: index.php, assets/
bin/          migrate.php, cron.php, create-admin.php
.github/      CI and release workflows
var/          cache, logs - outside the web root
```

## Writing an extension

Copy `extensions/example/`. An extension is a folder whose name is its id:

```
extensions/<id>/
  extension.json      id, name, version, api, namespace
  src/Extension.php   implements Modulento\Core\Extension\Extension
  templates/          rendered as "@<id>/file.twig"
  lang/de.php en.php  every key starts with "<id>."
  migrations/*.sql    run when the extension is enabled; tables are x_<id>_<name>
```

`register()` announces everything through the `Registrar`:

| Call | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `routes(fn (Router $r) => ...)` | Routes. Each states its access: `Router::PUBLIC`, `Router::AUTH` (default) or a permission name |
| `permission(name, labelKey)` | A permission that roles can be given |
| `adminMenu(labelKey, path, permission)` | An entry in the administration menu |
| `listen(EventClass, fn ($event, App $app) => ...)` | React to a core or extension event |
| `task(name, everyMinutes, fn (App $app) => ...)` | Scheduled work, run by `bin/cron.php` |

Rules, which also bind first-party extensions:

1. Core tables are only used through core classes, never by SQL. A foreign
   key to a core primary key is the one allowed reference.
2. Core files are never edited. Use events, own templates or a theme.
3. The router checks access and the CSRF token before a handler runs. A
   `POST` form needs `{{ csrf_field() }}`; an AJAX call sends the token as
   `_csrf` or as `X-CSRF-Token` header.
4. `App::API_VERSION` is the version of this interface. An extension states
   the version it was written for in `extension.json` and is not loaded on a
   mismatch.
